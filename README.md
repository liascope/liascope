Liascope is a JavaScript-based app that provides astrology enthusiasts with a user-friendly interface to explore their personal horoscope. Designed with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, it aims to offer easy-to-understand astrological insights for beginners. The app uses modern JavaScript features, such as ES6 syntax and Clean Code principles, to ensure maintainability and scalability.

Status
The app is currently a work in progress. While the core functionality is implemented, there are still improvements to be made. Future updates will focus on enhancing the user experience and adding more features. These updates will include:

Developing a responsive design to ensure the app works seamlessly on all devices.

Displaying current Moon phases to provide users with more astrological insights.

Adding explanations for the aspects, houses, and planetary positions to help users better understand their horoscope.

Architecture
The app is built following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, which separates the logic of the application into three interconnected components:

Model: Contains the data and business logic. For data storage, an object is used to manage the astrological data, such as the positions of the planets and other celestial bodies.

View: Handles the presentation layer, responsible for rendering the charts and user interface.

Controller: Manages the interaction between the model and the view, coordinating user input and updating the view accordingly.
